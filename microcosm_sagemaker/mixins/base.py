    We want to test a variety of model structures while making it easy to swap out models
    in a larger training harness.

    As such, we rely on the basic conventions laid out by sklearn.  Namely, we `fit` when
    we want to train (or otherwise analyze our data) and output model artifacts to a specified
    location on disk.  We `load` when we want to serialize a model from disk.  And finally we
    `transform` when we want to predict on a new datapoint.

    This bundle base also provides some helper logic around random seeds to make sure that
    training loops are reproducable.
